== SUMMARY

This is the source distribution repository for verilog-mode, the Verilog
editing and AUTOs package which is part of GNU Emacs
(lisp/progmodes/verilog-mode.el).

Verilog-Mode supports syntax highlighting of SystemVerilog (IEEE
1800-2017), Verilog (IEEE 1364-2005), and the Universal Verification
Modeling language (UVM).  Verilog-Mode also has AUTOs which greatly
accelerate maintaining interconnect, resets, and other boiler-plate code.

== DOCUMENTATION

See https://www.veripool.org/verilog-mode for more information.

== INSTALLATION

See https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilog-mode/wiki/Installing

== TESTS

The main purpose of this repository is the extended test suite.
(Verilog-mode.el itself being both here and in the GNU Emacs repository.)

To run the tests, make sure both GNU Emacs and Xemacs are installed, then:

   make
   make test

Under the hood this is (mostly) running `0test.el`.  This reads in each
file under `tests/` directory, AUTOs, reindents, and compares the result to
the matching filename in the `tests_ok` directory.

Test failures generally look like this:

   diff -c tests_ok/autoinout_ma.v e/t/autoinout_ma.v
   ***Golden Reference File
   ---Generated Test File
   --- GOLDEN_REFERENCE
   +++ CURRENT_BEHAVIOR
   ...
   -   output sina,
   +   output siuna,
   To promote current to golden, in shell buffer hit newline anywhere in next line (^P RETURN):
   cp e/t/autoinout_ma.v tests_ok/autoinout_ma.v; VERILOG_MODE_START_FILE=tests_ok/autoinout_ma.v make test_emacs

This indicates the generated output doesn't match what is in tests_ok.  To
fix this make sure that the change is expected then do the `cp` shown to
update the golden references:

   cp e/t/autoinout_ma.v tests_ok/autoinout_ma.v

Then `make test` again.  The output also suggests a
`VERILOG_MODE_START_FILE` which can also be used to jump right to that
individual test inside the `make test`.
